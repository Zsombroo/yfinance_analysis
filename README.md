### Automatic data fetcher service

This project contains a systemd service that downloads the latest available data on yahoo finance after booting. I wrote the service this way because I run it on my laptop that I use every day so it fetches the latest data whenever I start working.

#### Run the following commands to installation the service on Fedora:

```
sudo cp unix_service/yfinance.service /etc/systemd/system/yfinance.service
systemctl enable yfinance.service
systemctl start yfinance.service
```

#### Run the following commands to remove the service on Fedora:

```
systemctl disable yfinance.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/yfinance.service
```

#### Alternative method

You will most likely need to add execution permission so first run the following commands:

```
chmod +x unix_service/install_service.sh
chmod +x unix_service/start_service.sh
```

You can also install the service and restart it anytime using the following scripts:

```
unix_service/install_service.sh
unix_service/start_service.sh
```
